# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — phase 3, the composite tools

- `company_snapshot`. Profile, serving officers, charges and insolvency in one
  call, with signals derived across all of them.
- `screen_companies`. Up to 50 names or numbers in, one row each out.
- `signals`: facts read off the register as `{ code, detail }`. Deliberately
  no score, grade or traffic light — see ADR 7.
- Partial results. A snapshot survives one broken section and reports it under
  `sections_unavailable`; `sections_included` tells a missing signal apart from
  a section nobody read.
- A 404 on charges or insolvency is treated as "none", which is what Companies
  House means by it, rather than as an outage.
- `screen_companies` never guesses an ambiguous name — those come back under
  `unresolved` with candidates — and never truncates silently: anything skipped
  for rate-limit budget comes back under `not_screened` with the reason and the
  reset time.
- Bounded-concurrency helper, four requests in flight.

### Added — phase 2, the tool surface

- MCP server over stdio, with nine read-only tools: `find_company`,
  `find_officer`, `get_company`, `get_officers`, `get_filing_history`,
  `get_charges`, `get_psc`, `get_insolvency`, `get_officer_appointments`.
- Projection layer. Upstream payloads are read defensively field by field;
  output is validated strictly against published Zod schemas. Derived fields
  that Companies House does not provide: overdue-filing flags, company age,
  outstanding charge count, active appointment count, officer IDs lifted out
  of URLs.
- Retrieval tools refuse a company name and name `find_company` as the next
  step, before any request is made.
- `find_company` reports `disambiguation_needed` when several candidates come
  back and none matches exactly.
- Officer service addresses are withheld unless `verbose` is set.
- `scripts/measure-projections.ts`, and a test that holds the README's size
  claim to the measured range.

### Changed

- Corrected the claimed saving from the projection layer. It was described as
  "roughly an order of magnitude" in phase 1; measured against the fixtures it
  is 29% to 42%. The code was right, the claim was not.
- `bin` now points at `dist/bin.js`. Importing the package no longer starts a
  server or reads the environment.
- `RequestMeta` carries `ageMs` for cached answers, surfaced to callers as
  `meta.age_seconds`.

### Added — phase 1, the transport foundation

- HTTP client for the Companies House public data API with basic-auth key
  handling, per-request timeouts and jittered retry on 429 and 5xx.
- Sliding-window rate limiter sized to the documented 600 requests per five
  minutes, with a configurable safety margin and optional tightening from the
  undocumented `X-Ratelimit-*` response headers.
- Two-layer response cache (memory and disk) with per-resource TTLs and
  conditional revalidation where the API returns an HTTP `ETag`.
- Typed error model. Every failure carries a stable code, a plain-language
  message and a next-step hint rather than surfacing a stack trace.
- Company number normalisation, including zero-padding of short numeric input.
- Structured stderr logger. Nothing is ever written to stdout, which the stdio
  transport owns.
